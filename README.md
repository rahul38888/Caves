# Caves
#### Using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) as render engine
* Procedural cave generation 
* Dijkstra's Algorithm tO detect the shortest path 
* Flood fill algorithm to detect regions (rooms)
* Line algorithm me connect isolated regions

## Snapshot

New cave is generated every time the app is initialized.
The Red keep following the Green around using Dijkstra's Algorithm (for Green) until it caches it

## Controls
Key | Function
------------ | -------------
T | New random position for Green (target)
Arrow Keys | To move Green around the caves
Esc | Exist

### Enjoy!
